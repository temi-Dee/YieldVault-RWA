# Contributing to YieldVault-RWA

First off, thank you for considering contributing to YieldVault-RWA! It's people like you that make this project great.

## Secret Scanning & Prevention

This repository uses **gitleaks** to prevent accidental commits of secrets (API keys, private keys, passwords, etc.).

### Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit hook runs automatically before each `git commit` to scan for secrets in staged files. If secrets are detected, the commit will be blocked.

#### Installation

The pre-commit hook is already configured via **Husky**. When you clone the repository:

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes husky setup)
npm install
```

The hook is located at `.husky/pre-commit` and runs `scripts/secrets-check.js`.

#### Manual Setup (if needed)

```bash
# Install husky
npm install husky --save-dev

# Initialize husky
npx husky init

# Create the pre-commit hook
echo 'node scripts/secrets-check.js' > .husky/pre-commit

# Configure git to use husky hooks
git config core.hooksPath .husky
```

#### Bypassing the Hook (Use with Caution)

If you encounter a false positive, you can bypass the hook:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

**⚠️ Never bypass the hook for actual secrets!**

#### What the Hook Detects

The hook scans for common secret patterns including:
- AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- Private Keys (RSA, EC, DSA)
- API Keys and Secret Tokens
- Passwords in code
- Bearer Tokens and JWTs
- Stripe API Keys
- Slack Tokens
- Database connection strings

### GitHub Secret Scanning

GitHub's built-in secret scanning is enabled on this repository. When secrets are pushed to the repository:

1. GitHub will alert you via the Security tab
2. Alerts are routed to the security team based on repository settings
3. Push protection blocks commits containing known secret patterns

To configure secret scanning alerts:
1. Go to **Repository Settings** → **Security** → **Secret scanning**
2. Review and configure alert notifications
