# Vault Deposit & Withdrawal Lifecycle Sequence Diagrams

This document covers the complete request-to-confirmation lifecycle for deposit and withdrawal operations in YieldVault, from the user's wallet interaction through the Soroban smart contract to on-chain confirmation.

---

## Deposit Lifecycle

A deposit moves USDC from the user's wallet into the vault and mints proportional `yvUSDC` shares back to the user.

    participant USDC as USDC Token (SAC)
    participant Vault as YieldVault Contract

    User->>Frontend: Enter deposit amount
    Frontend->>Frontend: Validate: amount > 0, meets min_deposit
    Frontend->>RPC: simulate_transaction(deposit)
    RPC-->>Frontend: Simulated shares_to_mint, fee estimate

    Frontend->>User: Show preview (shares, share price, fee)
    User->>Freighter: Confirm & sign transaction

    Freighter-->>Frontend: Signed XDR transaction

    Frontend->>RPC: submit_transaction(signed XDR)
    RPC->>Vault: deposit(user, amount)

    Note over Vault: CHECKS
    Vault->>Vault: amount > 0
    Vault->>Vault: not paused
    Vault->>Vault: amount >= min_deposit
    Vault->>Vault: user_deposit + amount <= per_user_cap

    Note over Vault: EFFECTS
    Vault->>Vault: shares = amount * total_shares / total_assets
    Vault->>Vault: total_assets += amount
    Vault->>Vault: total_shares += shares
    Vault->>Vault: share_balance[user] += shares
    Vault->>Vault: user_deposit[user] += amount

    Note over Vault: INTERACTIONS
    Vault->>USDC: transfer(user → vault, amount)
    USDC-->>Vault: OK

    Vault->>RPC: emit event("deposit", amount, shares)
    Vault-->>RPC: Return shares_minted

    RPC-->>Frontend: Transaction result (success, ledger, hash)
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/v1/vault/deposit (index event)
    Backend->>RPC: getEvents(contractId, ledger)
    RPC-->>Backend: deposit event confirmed
    Backend-->>Frontend: Deposit indexed

    Frontend-->>User: Show confirmation (shares minted, tx hash)
```

### Deposit State Transitions

```
IDLE
  │
  ▼ User submits amount
VALIDATING (frontend checks: amount > 0, meets min_deposit, within cap)
  │
  ▼ Simulation passes
AWAITING_SIGNATURE (Freighter prompt shown)
  │
  ▼ User signs
SUBMITTING (XDR sent to Soroban RPC)
  │
  ├─ Contract rejects ──► FAILED
  │   (paused / below min / exceeds cap / zero amount)
  │
  ▼ Contract accepts
CONFIRMING (waiting for ledger close ~5 s)
  │
  ▼ Ledger closes
CONFIRMED
  └─ deposit event emitted on-chain
  └─ yvUSDC shares credited to user
```

### Deposit Error Paths

| Error | VaultError Code | Cause | User Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InvalidAmount` | 3 | Amount ≤ 0 | Enter a positive amount |
| `ContractPaused` | 4 | Vault is paused | Wait for admin to unpause |
| `MinDepositNotMet` | 6 | Amount < `min_deposit` | Increase deposit amount |
| `ExceedsUserCap` | 5 | Would exceed per-user cap | Reduce amount |

---

## Withdrawal Lifecycle

Withdrawals have two paths depending on whether the requested amount exceeds the `large_withdrawal_threshold`.

### Path A — Standard Withdrawal (below threshold)

    participant Backend as Backend API
    participant RPC as Stellar Soroban RPC

    participant Vault as YieldVault Contract

    User->>Frontend: Enter shares to withdraw
    Frontend->>RPC: simulate_transaction(withdraw)
    RPC-->>Frontend: Simulated assets_to_return, fee estimate

    Frontend->>User: Show preview (USDC to receive, share price)
    User->>Freighter: Confirm & sign transaction

    Freighter-->>Frontend: Signed XDR transaction
    Frontend->>RPC: submit_transaction(signed XDR)
    RPC->>Vault: withdraw(user, shares)

    Note over Vault: CHECKS
    Vault->>Vault: shares > 0
    Vault->>Vault: share_balance[user] >= shares
    Vault->>Vault: not paused
    Vault->>Vault: assets_to_return = shares * total_assets / total_shares
    Vault->>Vault: assets_to_return <= large_withdrawal_threshold ✓

    Note over Vault: EFFECTS
    Vault->>Vault: total_assets -= assets_to_return
    Vault->>Vault: total_shares -= shares
    Vault->>Vault: share_balance[user] -= shares
    Vault->>Vault: user_deposit[user] -= assets_to_return (floor 0)

    Note over Vault: INTERACTIONS
    Vault->>USDC: transfer(vault → user, assets_to_return)
    USDC-->>Vault: OK

    Vault->>RPC: emit event("withdraw", user, assets_to_return, shares)
    Vault-->>RPC: Return assets_to_return

    RPC-->>Frontend: Transaction result (success, ledger, hash)
    Frontend->>Backend: Index withdraw event
    Backend-->>Frontend: Withdrawal indexed
    Frontend-->>User: Show confirmation (USDC received, tx hash)
```

### Path B — Large Withdrawal with 24-Hour Timelock

    Frontend->>User: Warn: 24-hour timelock applies
    User->>Freighter: Confirm & sign transaction

    Freighter-->>Frontend: Signed XDR

    RPC->>Vault: withdraw(user, shares)

    Note over Vault: CHECKS
    Vault->>Vault: shares > 0
    Vault->>Vault: share_balance[user] >= shares
    Vault->>Vault: not paused

    Note over Vault: EFFECTS (lock only — no transfer yet)
    Vault->>Vault: pending_withdrawal[user] = {shares, unlock_ts: now + 86400}

    %% ── Phase 2: Execute after timelock ────────────────────────────
    Note over User,Vault: Phase 2 — Execute After 24-Hour Timelock

    User->>Frontend: Return after unlock_ts has passed
    Frontend->>RPC: simulate_transaction(execute_withdrawal)
    RPC-->>Frontend: Simulated assets_to_return

    Frontend->>User: Show: "Ready to claim X USDC"
    User->>Freighter: Confirm & sign execute_withdrawal

    Note over Vault: EFFECTS
    Vault->>Vault: Remove pending_withdrawal[user]
    Vault->>Vault: total_assets -= assets_to_return
    Vault->>Vault: total_shares -= shares
    Vault->>Vault: user_deposit[user] -= assets_to_return (floor 0)

    Note over Vault: INTERACTIONS

                                           └─ USDC transferred to user
```

### Withdrawal Error Paths

| Error | VaultError Code | Cause | User Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InvalidAmount` | 3 | Shares ≤ 0 | Enter a positive share amount |
| `InsufficientShares` | 2 | User balance < requested shares | Reduce share amount |
| `ContractPaused` | 4 | Vault is paused | Wait for admin to unpause |
| `TimelockNotExpired` | 7 | `execute_withdrawal` called too early | Wait until `unlock_ts` |
| `NoPendingWithdrawal` | 8 | No pending withdrawal exists | Initiate withdrawal first |

## Share Price Mechanics

Both deposit and withdrawal use the same share price formula, ensuring fair value exchange at all times.

```
Share Price  =  total_assets / total_shares

Deposit:
  shares_minted  =  amount × total_shares / total_assets
                    (= amount if first deposit, when total_shares = 0)

Withdrawal:
  assets_returned  =  shares × total_assets / total_shares
```

Yield accrual increases `total_assets` without changing `total_shares`, which raises the share price and benefits all depositors proportionally.

## Event Reference

| Event | Emitted When | Key Data |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | Deposit succeeds | `amount`, `shares_minted` |
| `pndwdraw` | Large withdrawal initiated (timelocked) | `shares`, `unlock_timestamp` |
| `withdraw` | Withdrawal completes (standard or after timelock) | `assets_returned`, `shares_burned` |
